usage: 
gcc -o ping ping.c
./ping [ -t ttl] [-4]/[-6] target

The program will keep sending ICMP "echo requests" every 1 second, and reporting RTT when receiving "echo reply" messages. 
If none "echo reply" is received in set TTL, the program will report "time exceeded‚Äù. Default TTL is 3s.
When ctrl+c is pressed, the program will report packet loss and exit.
Note: IPv6 support hasn't been tested because my ISP doesn't support IPv6.
